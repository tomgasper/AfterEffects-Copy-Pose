# AfterEffects-Copy-Pose

Copy Pose is a simple After Effects script that allows animators to quickly copy their rigged character poses without having to go through each property manually.

## What it does

The script looks for keyframes from all of the selected layers at specified time mark and copies them to a new place on the timeline.
It also allows the user to add custom markers and move them between nested composition.
